#### Overview
Texas Hold ‘Em Simulator is a multi user application aimed at providing an environment for players to hone their skills and challenge one another to games of heads-up Texas Hold ‘Em Poker on a single device.  The application simulates the flow of a poker game by having users choose what actions to perform within the game (fold, raise, call or check ) when it is their turn. Once the hand being played reaches its conclusion, a winner is determined and the chip counts for each player are adjusted if necessary.
